A guide to turning a handheld bluetooth keyboard into a remote control on android.

## Keyboard to use
I used the Rii dual use keyboard to connect to android phone with bluetooth.

## Remote control function
There is an app to intercept key presses from a specific keyboard device and perform commands based on that.

## Performing arbitrary actions
This can call task functions 

## Troubleshooting
I have had this app not working for some devices (specifically TCL devices). I have had success with SAMSUNG devices so far.

## Serverless connection to the internet
I have had success with use google sheets to trigger events.
