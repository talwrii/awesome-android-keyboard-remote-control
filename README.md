A guide to turning a handheld bluetooth keyboard into a remote control on android.

## Keyboard to use
I used the Rii dual use keyboard to connect to android phone with bluetooth.

## Remote control function

They [Keyboard mapper app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.github.sds100.keymapper) can intercept key presses from a specific keyboard device and perform actions, including creating other key events or running Tasker commands.

## Performing arbitrary actions
[Tasker](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.dinglisch.android.taskerm) is a graphical programming language for android that can be used to perform arbitrary actions and provides a number of convenient options.

## Troubleshooting
I have had this app not working for some devices (specifically TCL devices). I have had success with SAMSUNG devices so far.

## Serverless internet actions
I have had success with use google sheets to trigger events.
